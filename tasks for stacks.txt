In a typical stack data structure, the primary operations are indeed Push, Pop, and Peek. However, depending on your specific use case or requirements, you may want to implement additional operations or features on top of these basic operations. Here are some common extensions and additional operations you can consider:

1. **IsEmpty:** Check if the stack is empty. This operation can help you determine whether there are any elements in the stack.

2. **IsFull:** Check if the stack is full. This is important in cases where the stack has a maximum capacity, and you want to ensure you don't exceed it.

3. **Size:** Get the current number of elements in the stack. This operation provides the size of the stack without modifying its contents.

4. **Clear:** Remove all elements from the stack, effectively resetting it to an empty state.

5. **Search:** Search for a specific element within the stack and return its position/index. This operation would involve popping elements one by one until the target is found or the stack is empty.

6. **Duplicate:** Create a copy of the stack, duplicating its contents. This can be useful for backup or cloning purposes.



7. **Reverse:** Reverse the order of elements in the stack. This operation can be achieved by popping all elements from the original stack and pushing them onto a new stack.

8. **Sort:** Sort the elements in the stack if they are comparable. You can pop all elements into an array, perform sorting on the array, and then push them back onto the stack.

9. **Merge:** Combine two stacks into one. This is especially useful when working with multiple stacks and you want to consolidate their contents.

10. **Iterator:** Implement an iterator or enumerator to iterate through all elements in the stack. This can be helpful when you need to process or display all elements.

11. **PeekN:** Extend the Peek operation to allow you to peek at the nth element from the top without removing it.

12. **PushAll:** Push a collection of elements onto the stack in one operation, which can be useful when you have multiple elements to add at once.

The choice of additional operations depends on the specific requirements of your application. You can tailor the stack data structure to suit your needs by adding the operations that make sense for your use case.
